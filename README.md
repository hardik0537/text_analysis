# text_analysis

### This project gives an introduction to the application of machine learning algorithms in the field of real time text analysis. This text can be fetched from a social platform like Twitter (in our case) or just a static text in the form of an CSV. It also leverages the use of Apache Spark. Each folder has a separate readme which explains the working.
